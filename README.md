# Data Cleaning Challenge in Excel, SQL, Python

This project showcases my ability to clean and transform raw data using three different platformsâ€”**Excel**, **SQL**, and **Python**. The goal of this challenge was to demonstrate versatility in data cleaning techniques and achieve the same output regardless of the tool used. 

## Objective

The raw dataset was cleaned to remove inconsistencies, handle missing data, and standardize formats. This project highlights:
- Proficiency in **Excel** for data manipulation.
- Expertise in **SQL** for querying and cleaning data.
- Advanced use of **Python** for programmatic data cleaning.

## Dataset

The raw dataset used for this challenge can be found in the repository: [Customer_Call_List.xlsx](https://github.com/MekhzZ/Data_Cleaning_Challenge_in_Excel_SQL_Python/blob/main/Customer%20Call%20List.xlsx).

## Outputs

The final cleaned dataset is identical across all three approaches, ensuring consistency and reliability.

## Methods and Files

### 1. **Excel**
- **File:** [Data_Cleaning_Excel.xlsx](https://github.com/MekhzZ/Data_Cleaning_Challenge_in_Excel_SQL_Python/blob/main/Data_Cleaning_Excel.xlsx)
- **Tools Used:** 
  - Conditional formatting to identify errors.
  - Data filters and pivot tables.


### 2. **SQL**
- **File:** [Data_Cleaning_SQL.sql](https://github.com/MekhzZ/Data_Cleaning_Challenge_in_Excel_SQL_Python/blob/main/Data_Cleaning_SQL.sql)
- **Tools Used:**
  - SQL queries to handle missing data and duplicates.
  - use of 'UPDATE','ALTER','WHERE','REPLACE'

### 3. **Python**
- **File:** [Data_cleaning_Python.ipynb](https://github.com/MekhzZ/Data_Cleaning_Challenge_in_Excel_SQL_Python/blob/main/Data_cleaning_Python.ipynb)
- **Tools Used:**
  - **Pandas** for data manipulation.
  - Handling missing values with `fillna()`.
  - Data standardization using string operations.

## Results

The cleaning process addressed the following key issues:
1. **Missing Data:** Filled or removed based on logical rules.
2. **Inconsistent Formatting:** Standardized text cases, trimmed whitespace, and corrected errors.
3. **Duplicates:** Identified and removed duplicate rows.

## How to Access

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MekhzZ/Data_Cleaning_Challenge_in_Excel_SQL_Python.git
   ```


2. Explore individual methods:
 - Open Data_Cleaning_Excel.xlsx for Excel steps.
 - Use a database to run data_cleaning_sql.sql for SQL.
 - Run the Jupyter Notebook data_cleaning_python.ipynb for Python.


## Insights and Learnings
  - Excel: Great for quick visual inspections and small datasets but less scalable for large datasets.
  - SQL: Ideal for structured data in relational databases; efficient for complex queries.
  - Python: Most flexible and scalable, with robust libraries for advanced data manipulation.
